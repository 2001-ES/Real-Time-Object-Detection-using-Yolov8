# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-Yolov8
This project implements a Real-Time Object Detection System using deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv8) and OpenCV. It can detect and label multiple objects in live video feeds from a webcam or video file with high accuracy and speed.

# Features
Real-time object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model
Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores
Easy integration with webcam or external video sources
Supports multiple object classes (e.g., person, car, knife, etc.)
